0	Second , I recommend greasing the groove , which means several times a day hanging on the bar for about 50 percent of your max hold time . It 's all about doing submaximal sets . You want to practice frequently while keeping yourself feeling as fresh as possible . Grease the groove every single day .
1	Or in the case of top fuel for any cars , they have a handbrake left for braking . No actual brake pedal . Top fuels don 't even have front brakes , just rear .
2	They have more like basically , a little bit of a head start before the timer starts . The top fuel , funny cars have external starters that they hook up to the blower .
3	They do have a part called the reverser , so they can back up the car from their burnout . Due to the enormous strain on the clutch , they rebuild it each run .
4	The batteries for the starters are mounted on the golf carts . They even have a spare starter in case one fails . I like the glasses .
5	But there is another interaction going on here with this low pressure field , and that is perhaps further away than you may anticipate .
6	When it comes to the forwards backwards movement of the wing , one of the key considerations to take into account is aerodynamic balancing .
7	So the higher we go , the more the drag force pulls back . Thankfully , the drag force is an order of magnitude less than the down force force .
8	Now , if you move your wing further forwards , you can make more downforce with it for the same level of aero-balance .
9	So basically , you theoretically want the wing forwards to make most downforce of the wing for balance , but this causes issues with interactions with the rear of the car .
10	So we 're here at the Meiji Shrine . The Meiji Shrine was actually created to commemorate the emperor Meiji and his empress here in Tokyo .
11	I am in a park , in Japan , petting bunnies for free and is so soft .
12	It 's supposed to relieve you of any negative energy before you present that to the gods . So let me show you how it 's done now .
13	They will be happy to forward your questions to us . We have regular meetings with them so nothing gets lost if you file your questions either with ASAM directly or with our colleagues from C-ASAM in China .
14	ASAM is concerned with what goes directly into your development and what might even go into the league .
15	but which are complementary to each other . For example , we have something defining the domain ontology ASAM OpenXOntology Then we have ASAM ODD to define the operational design domain .
16	So you see the whole span from the simulation to the actual operation of the vehicle .
17	What 's wrong with that one ? They must have actually thought that 's what i look like .
18	Dr. Mike . I know he 's a big fan of my content on Youtube . Let 's not talk any more about that .
19	which kind of goes along with this celebrity idea . Don 't ever try that .
20	I want to give you guys some free money , but i need to see if you guys are loyal subscribers .
21	Are you still craving candy ? Yeah , i 'm gonna stay here forever . So i 've just been hanging out on the scaffold
22	It took a lot of work , so i would really appreciate it , if you could subscribe . And with that being said , here 's what the ten million dollar house looked like before , and here 's what it looks like after we customized it .
23	One ! Go ! Go ! Ben , do you want the Macbook Pro ? Speed it up .
24	Poo . We just completed this giant lightbulb painting and since we 're painting a house in this video , i thought it would be fitting if we paid rent for subscribers who really need it .
25	and the faster you go , it 's just the noisier it gets . Number three is the power . Car produces 98 horsepower from the factory and 90 pound feet of torque . 90 . And I put my foot down now . No power , no power , no pass , some power 4000 rpm .
26	then it 's a no brainer . Don 't do it . But more often than you think we 're doing stuff in that last category . A recent example is the use of antibacterial soaps . That 's the topic of this week 's Healthcare Triage . Let 's start with the " benefits ‚Äù .
27	emerging resistance in bacteria . In the lab they found that the use of these soaps did appear to increase the number of antibiotic resistant bacteria found . Unfortunately , though these studies appeared to be underpowered , the trends did look worrisome . Even the possibility that we 're creating resistance is a problem .
28	That is delicious , so it 's really tender mutton and you get a nice tomato flavor .
29	Yeah , look at that . Oh wow . It looks like a swiss roll , almost so let me try to dig into that .
30	This blue one behind me is really beautiful . These ones right here . Such a cool shop !
31	Let 's find out these have less cheese . Again I just feel like i haven 't been looking at my food .
32	I don 't know . They made that these look the same . They look the same . Man . Alright , at this point , you 're just eating a bunch of doritos . And i 'm having a great time .
33	They 're all great . All those are small . Now I 'm just eating them . They 're all in my mouth together . That 's what I do , but I know which one is the Lay 's .
34	Our store brand chips better than name brand chips . Let 's talk about that . Good Mythical Morning .
35	So here 's a common nighttime page . Patient M. Smith is unable to sleep . Mental status is okay and pain is controlled .
36	When compared to the benzodiazepines . The precautions and side effects with these drugs are all similar to the above , but less frequently observed and less severe .
37	Lastly , for patients who have a significant anxiety component to their insomnia , benzos may actually be the most appropriate option .
38	One of the most illogical things that i see clinicians do when treating acute inpatient insomnia is to preferentially use antidepressants in patients with concurrent depression .
39	The second consideration is that if you want us as Eurazeo to invest in a Japanese company on a very specific technology versus its US peer , then we also need to feel that the Japanese team isn 't just only superior technology , but that it can scale fast globally .
40	Thank you , Alex . Okay , thank you , Bryan . Thanks again to all the panelists today for your sharing and for everything we have covered .
41	I 'm gonna call this fixed . Like so , and then i may have to .
42	So if we come over and let 's just go and grab this and open this up in a new tab .
43	Now if we give this a moment , this should start coming down gradually as it 's kind of releasing the load that the cpu had on it because of whatever was going on in that plex image , so we 're gonna let that continue .
44	We 're gonna restart the plex server here . Take a look here .
45	So there , there 's an issue that we 've that we 've run into in the past , so that 's .
46	If a patient has a normal ph , but also a high pco2 , high bicarb and normal anion gap .
47	Even if they are recognized , their severity may be underappreciated , as severity of these conditions is determined in part by the arterial ph .
48	There is no other explanation . As i said earlier , i certainly would not expect anyone to memorize this chart , but with time and practice you will be able to reconstruct it on your own .
49	Example 2 . A 14 year old girl with bulimia is brought to the ER after being found unresponsive at home with an empty pill bottle nearby .
50	Vitals on admission , temperature 37 . 0 , heart rate 145 , blood pressure 78 over 42 .
51	Actually , this would not be possible without this wide range of partners that we 've been working with . I 'm ready to see the total business , system integrators and we software defined why there are network vendors that actually help us with their technology to build software
52	There is so much interesting innovation going on in space . It absolutely is the next frontier and as always , nadib has been very closely connected to the startup world and so in basically we launched the robotics and startup accelerator .
53	And so we worked hard over the years to make it easy to couple things like Lambda with Kinesis and with managed kafka and with DynamoDB streams .
54	If i go back and i update my Lambda function and i rerun Sam build , then it 's going to do an incremental build because i didn 't make any changes to my dependencies .
55	And another thing that we launched earlier this year is Sam Pipelines . In the spirit of there 's just some critical stuff that you have to do to be able to be efficient in the cloud , but that 's not special to your business .
56	So our goal is to provide a wide array of event sources . We have over 180 AWS services .
57	and this is off the back of me watching Cells At Work Black the other day . I forgot the original Cells At Work did have some bite to it too . And we get a little platelet too to open things up . They know what they 're doing .
58	Releasing them into the world . What ? The megakaryocyte brings out a gold medal , 100 % accurate as we said .
59	is designed to actually squeeze through so it will physically bend as it goes through these tiny capillaries . " Listen , I hope you don 't mind my asking , but have you seen 1146 ? " That 's the name of the white blood cell .
60	I didn 't know that was actually in there . Cool . That 's another card for us . Kuriboh , you gotta have kuriboh . A Monster Reborn .
61	Who knows ? Go multiply again .
62	Then of course you gotta have the Black Magic Ritual . And also Emblem of Dragon Destroyer .
63	Okay , okay , okay . It starts like pushing inside my body . All right , there 's a little more then , okay , it 's actually feels tight in the shoulders .
64	You wanna put in a lot of pressure ? Yeah . But i still got some , some . Some slack ?
65	I want to try to relax and you can tighten like as tight as possible . So you 're going a hundred percent on this ? Yeah . I 'm in my pupa T-shirt .
66	Well , they 'll take it . Well , there won 't be a bed in a room of you . You can 't do that .
67	Look at that . Look at all the lovely shiny buttons .
68	We 've got these timer relays , and they are going to supply electricity for a specific amount of time , to each of the features we built into the bunk bath .
69	It 's not to be recommended . It 's going to be a lot more fun . If you don 't know what the switch does until you press it .
70	I 'm gonna make it so it tips so they 'll think they 're all nice and safe and then I can be like boo and soak em all .
71	Nevertheless , i think that does look pretty cool actually , i do like it . It 's only tiny , but you know , last project was massive .
72	Popcorn . Oh , yes . Welcome back , folks , to the Nick Zammeti .
73	I kind of added a massive diorama to loads of houses , and like woodlands , and trees , and driveways , and lights everywhere , even even a real water fountain .
74	When you caught the trapeze , it 's very hard to understand which one you want to turn . Oh , physics says that everything should work .
75	It 's gonna be epic . Stay tuned . So i 'm very happy that you 're becoming a part of my movie stunts in real life idea .
76	Not . So we haven 't even made it to the third level yet , and there 's already another swimming spot .
77	It 's the pinpoint RC lost plane tracker , and it sends the gps position of the plane , to your app via a cellular connection , so you can
78	For some reason , I 'm still not able to get it to go into return mode and just fly directly to home .
79	I don 't know what 's it doing . Oh , what 's it doing ?
80	Nice . Okay . Here we go . Going to drop it and put it into return mode .
81	I also just don 't know where it is . I spent a few minutes hacking away at the blackberry bushes , and I made an opening in the fence , right underneath the barbed wire , right there , and I found I went over to the other side and I found it .
82	I didn 't stand in place . Suck it . I 'm gonna bet five bucks that Doug gets an S.
83	That was so good though . I count that . Nice . Don 't die .
84	yeah , man , maybe I could do it , but I don 't know . Try it in the grass .
85	It had no balance , man . Whoa .
86	It 's hard . Alright it 's time now . Let 's try . I feel dropping . Gonna work at it .
87	And there we go , a Blackfeather Darkrage Dragon , which is like Black Winged Dragon . It 's like the , it 's a one in the manga , basically . Chronomaly sort of thing . Light and Black Luster Soldier .
88	I got this from strikezone online. com . You should check them out . Link in the description . It 's where I got my gold series boxes .
89	And that shark . Jinzo . Oh , it 's cool to see Jinzo again . I remember that one being in there .
90	It 's one of the best synchro monsters out there , even though it came a little bit later on . And Dark Armed Dragon . Speaking of evil dragon ,
91	And then what we 'll do is we give that a little bit of a mix . There we go , and then what we do ? We 'll just dab these .
92	Okay , it 's in the workshop and it 's still damp . Now i will say , folks , what i 'm about to attempt .
93	Well , it 's not really a trick . What you need a little bit of yellow , I say a lot of yellow paint and just a tiny weeny , little bit of orange .
94	This fits on there quite nicely , so now i am gonna flip this in a minute , so we 're gonna turn this over and it will all become apparent at some point .
95	The second will be increased concentration of anabolic hormones in your blood . It happens when you work out heavy , increasing concentration of free creatine in your muscle fibers and increasing concentration of hydrogen ions in your muscle fibers .
96	Oh , yeah , sure , I know there 's two types of hypertrophy that we can see . This is the muscle hypertrophy , which is myofibrils hypertrophy , and the sarcoplasmatic , right ?
97	Hey , everybody . Today we are going to talk about how to build your forearm muscles . And today I have a special guest . Six times American Ninja Warrior , and two times World Salmon Ladder Champion , Sean Bryan .
98	So the bigger muscle is the brachioradialis . So usually i do like four or five sets . Okay , so here 's this .
99	It 's a australian pull up , so there 's the australian pull ups here . Then you want to be bolder .
100	Now I am going to go through all the headset specs , while letting you know my impressions and test results .
101	Do keep in mind , to get the best tracking , you do need some space , but besides that , there is no complaints here at all . As for the controllers , if you get the full kit , you will get the old Vive Wand controllers .
102	Stay alive . Wow , that was one flip .
103	Yep , anything . Yep , anything goes . I would have given it to you .
104	That 's my turn again . Nollie shove . You can nollie shove that .
105	And this brings like good times . Good time for him . Tracks are a little loose .
106	It 's been a long way but she 's just arrived . This is absolutely fabulous to see Bandita in these conditions .
107	so they lose heat fast which is why they curl up into a tight ball to retain their body heat . Now she 's camouflaged in the snow this helps her hunt and avoid being hunted .
108	and soon it progresses up her legs and starts to work its way up her back . And then it envelops most of her body apart from the black tip on the tail . Stoats have a long thin body .
109	spreading further up her nose . And then a tail starts turning white , just above a black tip . The rest of her paws are next to change , along with the tips of her ears .
110	Recently I spotted a partially ermine stoat on my cameras at Fotherdale . Fingers crossed . It sticks around so I can capture this incredible process once again . Thank you for watching .
111	In the exhale , we 're going to extend and back .
112	Pull the abs in . Five , four , three , two , one .
113	Pull the abs in . Six , five , four , three , two and one . And hold . Ten , nine , eight , seven .
114	Keep your heels two inches above the mat in a hover . Keep your neck long and hold there for ten , nine .
115	I hope it 's going great , you guys . We are going to do a pilates workout , which Sanne 's gonna guide us through .
116	That 's just a tarp . We use that in sand or in the mud , or we 'll put it under our ladder at nighttime , sometimes .
117	Then i 'm running a wind booster acceleration or throttle controller , and that is fantastic so that changes the amount of input required to get the car going under acceleration .
118	and then the stainless steel cooking surface .
119	They work pretty well . I don 't use them a ton , but they work really well . Now these huge fenders here , now the Australian government or the roads , i guess .
120	Finally , a pulmonary embolism can cause abdominal pain , but as with ACS , would not be expected to cause abdominal tenderness .
121	The organization of a particular framework may just appeal more to some people than others .
122	Her temperature is 99<unk> 8 , heart rate 110 , blood pressure 132 over 80 , respiratory rate 26 and oxygen saturation of 98 percent on room air .
123	The subacromial bursa separates the supraspinatus and infr
124	Subacromial injection of the shoulder - animation you can see a basic anatomy of the shoulder showing the subarcomial bursa and the supraspinatus and the infraspinatus muscles the acromion bone and the clavicle
125	This bursa aids in the motion of the rotator cuff tendons in overhead activity . When this bursa inflamed , we call it subacromial bursitis .
126	will enter the marked site and aim towards the superior aspect of the acromion . The needle will be underneath the acromion . Aspirate or inject accordingly .
127	I usually inject 5 ml of one percent lidocaine and 1 ml of steroid solution . The site of injection is about 2 cm below the posterolateral corner of the acromion .
128	Okay , so this we 're gonna use . Okay , so next preparation , this is making the lobster salad inside .
129	and a little bit of chives . Green color .
130	Now we change other side . Ok ? Done . So first we make cooked salad , lobster salad .
131	Very nice . Okay . Then garlic , ginger and wasabi .
132	Okay . So thank you very much for watching today . It was great episode and very delicious episode .
133	I think all of these are really important and it 's one of the things that 's made the map program , our migration acceleration program , one of our most sought after programs .
134	Whyline has been working with San Nicholas and they use the well architected framework to optimize just in time service for citizens in that region .
135	It 's grapefruit , orange blossom , then it has ylang ylang in which i don 't like . I find it an old fashioned fragrance note and it 's just nice , you know , it 's just like a fresh , zesty floral , but instantly forgettable .
136	This is something that can become a sophisticated , classy , not overwhelming , but still something that people can smell on you and that it becomes what you 're known for . Again
137	It doesn 't have that patchouli in , so it 's pretty and white , but it also has this coconut and apricot warm notes in black currant as well , so it 's slightly fruity , but predominantly white floral .
138	It just smells basically like Chanel number five Eau De Toilette , like it 's too similar .
139	I love fruity notes and they make it warm and fun and make it a little bit more sexy . A little bit more evening .
140	So let 's say that there are settlements , which are these small house pieces laid out like this with colors corresponding to each player , red , blue and orange .
141	Since the blue player has a settlement on the four as well , they also get one grain .
142	The first is the year of plenty card , which can be used to select any two resources from the bank , and there are two of these cards .
143	In addition to trading with players , the active player can also trade with the bank at an exchange rate of four similar cards to one of any card .
144	And this would conclude the die rolling phase of the turn . After they roll , the orange players got some options in no particular order .
145	the limited edition Daisy Days Eau So Fresh is all about peach .
146	Is Tresor in Love , which is the partner of terror Tresor Midnight Rose , which I , you guys know I love .
147	Hi , i 'm Kevin Sorbo . In 1997 , i suffered three strokes at the age of 38 .
148	The American stroke association 's Together to End Stroke program offers valuable resources and tools to educate Americans that stroke is preventable , treatable and beatable .
149	One plug in here , so this one right there . Alright , next we have two other plugs .
150	I 'll link it right here . You guys can watch that . Cool . This is gonna look really good .
151	Definitely was not about to throw these back on no way , so this will look a lot better . Before i start reassembling all this stuff , i 'm gonna go ahead and wire up the paddles , assemble those with the new brackets , and then we 'll start working on the wheel .
152	Just got to tuck everything in the right places . I 'm probably going to look at my phone and make sure i have it all set up , right ? But the paddles come out here .
153	All right , so now it 's time to dismantle this guy . We gotta transfer all this stuff over to here . Just a few things you gotta take apart .
154	Hi , i 'm Kevin Sorbo , and because i care , i 'm here to tell you about stroke . Like my character Hercules ,
155	I 've shared my story and i encourage you to share yours with the American Stroke Association . Tell us why you care about stroke .
156	akt substrate of 40 kilodaltons , and the other one is deptor or dep domain containing mTOR interacting protein , and these both will ultimately regulate mTOR complex one activity , and there is also some regulation of the complex
157	So again AMP and LKB1 are activate AMPK . Some other things also activate in AMPK signaling as well , such as exercise .
158	This also leads to the inhibition of proteins upstream in the insulin signaling cascade , which would ultimately lead to a down regulation of mTOR complex one signaling , so mTOR complex one and some of its
159	leads to the activation of p53 and REDD1 , and these both lead ultimately to the activation of TSC2 . And again , once TSC2 is activated , that leads to inhibition of mTORC1 .
160	with outside of the complex . AKT , as you mentioned before , can regulate TSC2 , but it also directly inhibits PRAS 40 .
161	Initially , bronchiolitis symptoms are similar to the common cold , congestion , pharyngitis , sore throat and cough .
162	There 's no proven antiviral therapy for bronchiolitis , so treatment usually consists of supplemental oxygen and giving fluids to prevent dehydration .
163	For some kids at high risk of serious complications , like those born very prematurely with significant pulmonary disease like bronchopulmonary dysplasia or with congenital heart disease .
164	and get rid of carbon dioxide . Over time a serious RSV infection can lead to hypoxemia , which is a decreased oxygen content in the blood .
165	Flying FPV around the office park proved that this thing flies pretty darn well . So if you think about it , this control system of gimbal motors is actually more similar to the full scale rockets like the SpaceX Falcon 9 , because they vectored their motors around too .
166	It 's no race quad , but it flies . That 's for damn sure . In the last video , people were freaking out , because they thought that
167	Just spin out . To be honest , it just went right into the ground . Oh , this thing 's not even recording .
168	But anyways , the time has come . It 's the moment of truth . I 'm gonna take it up real high . Cut the throttle , let it drop , and then raise the throttle and see if it will save itself from doom .
169	And then if all works well , take it up high and let it fall . Just cut the motors completely , let it go into a free fall , and then see if it 'll recover when I raise the throttle .
170	Except this bit . First goal , little step up . On , off .
171	There is . But you 've done it now . I think that 's about it for me in the Bowl . To be honest with you , i don 't know . It 's not my domain at all .
172	Let 's switch pov and do a little run through it . What 's going on there ? They 're like all flat banks , the kind of steep ones .
173	Landing should just be there . As I look , there 's another half pedal back still . The quarter . That was cool .
174	We 've saved the best till last . That 's for sure . I 'm sure . I speak for loads of people when i say that growing up , being into action sports . Everybody has seen Woodward .
175	Let me say , though , here , that I don 't think that this is that noticeable if you don 't do a side by side comparison , because I did not notice this when I was playing games before comparing .
176	In any case , you need Vive software you can find on Vive<unk> com / setup This includes the Pro 2 drivers and the Vive console .
177	All I did notice is that the headset gets hot when turned on for a longer time .
178	In my opinion , this design is outdated , but it does compensate by being one of the most comfortable headsets out there .
179	But I 'll tell you right now . I 'm like 70 percent sure I 'm right . Cause these could be Fritos . That could be it .
180	Kroger brings it pretty hard . Blaze original big name in chips and a desirable bargaining chip in school playgrounds and prison yards .
181	You 're eating everything . Get your flag . Well , Link , you have . Yeah , all right , here we go .
182	They 're all smaller in size . The oil in those is real good . I was gonna say that it 's actually potato-ier and that 's a good thing .
183	I got a weakness for chips , man . Yeah , okay , three , two , one .
184	We also gave numerous talks over the years at KubeCon and other conferences . We also wrote a blog that describes our Hyperforce journey .
185	Let 's talk about some of the features we 've launched and what 's coming soon . We launched support for taints and parallel node upgrades .
186	You can see what others are saying , upvote and comment on things you 'd like to see or submit your own ideas , if you think we can do better .
187	This is a fine line here . Yeah , this one is real good . It 's so .
188	Oh yeah , that one time i was in prison . And i like . I like the curly ones , the ones that flop over on themselves .
189	I agree these taste the best . I 'm going out on a limb here , a curved limb . The real cheetos are in bowl number four .
190	Got to really dip something . Hell , yeah , they 're tasty too . Then down here we go .
191	suggests that Bond is investigating his death at the beginning of the story . And finally the last known 00 agent is a female . 0013 , known as Briony Thorne appears in comic strip Fear Face published in the early 70 ‚Äô s .
192	Roger Moore was the most promiscuous of Bonds . He bedded 19 women over 7 movies .
193	Remember to click that thumbs up button . That way we know you enjoy the content . Hit subscribe if you haven 't already because we have new stuff coming out each and every week and this is SlappedHam .
194	Who knows the OO ‚Äô s ? Here ‚Äô s a brief run down on those brazen enough to achieve 00 status .
195	001 is known as Edward Donne and is only referenced in the Raymond Benson Novel , Doubleshot . Over the course of 24 Bond films , James ‚Äô fellow secret agents 002 , 003 , 004 and 009 have been killed in action .
196	You 're writing log files into that data center , and then from data centers in the rest of the world , you 're going to go pull this data and keep it in sync with cross cluster replication .
197	You can search for errors , build visualizations to get right to the information you care about . It helps you turn raw data into insights .
198	You can run it on premises . You can run it on any cloud . You can run it on AWS . It works equally well everywhere . If you 're using Elasticsearch today ,
199	What we did to help make this easier was we created a feature we call a cross cluster replication .
200	Each column represents an upcoming open source release with the planned release date and within that each card is a feature or a distribution type or something that we 're thinking about .
201	If you can reach your upper arms towards one another , squeeze the shoulder blades , lift up the heart , inhale and exhale .
202	Gaze up between the palms and start sending your chest forward .
203	Drop your back heel down and rise up where you want . Inhale and exhale .
204	Sink the hips as low as you can activate in the core . Bring right elbow towards the outside of your left thigh and see if you can find your twist here .
205	Finally , we will discuss how customers can take inspiration from the two customer stories that we will share today and start the sustainability journey on AWS .
206	X5 % of our food is gonna to be sourced from within a 300 mile radius . House wines and beer coming from Oregon and Washington .
207	Within amazon , we have a map level view that shows all the buildings with some high level attributes displayed on the map .
208	Let me see if it 's this good . It 's good .
209	So you can go . She 's so mean with me , guys . What goes behind the scene is like nuts . What I have to endure ? Anyway .
210	Thank you . So we just came back to our room after a very cool morning . That half day on the boat was like , so much better than I expected . The .
211	Don 't extubate too soon , or patient may become apneic and require manual ventilation and laryngoscope may occur , which is spasm , and the muscles in the larynx , which can make ventilation very difficult .
212	Reduce or turn off the vapor , but continue to ventilate the patient until the patient begins to make ventilatory efforts on himself or by himself or by herself , and let them take control of the ventilation as they
213	We usually call their name and if they open their eyes and i ask them if they 're having pain or you know , whatever , and they respond appropriately . I 'll extubate so you deflate the cuff and you pull the tube out .
214	Now this one 's got a lot of nacho cheese . That 's a good chip .
215	Okay , you ready ? No . You ready ?
216	That hit me is a doritoness and it just hit me when i ate him and that 's what i went with .
217	What is that ? Okay , so starting from my left , it 's Clover Valley from Dollar General .
218	Three , two , one . I 'm going for the thinnest one . And you , you know what you may be
219	One important step that we take at NCBI is to cluster ESTs based on their sequence , which has the effect of placing ESTs from the same gene into the same cluster .
220	Binding of the applied sample mRNA , which was converted to a cDNA to a gene sequence is measured as light intensity and color .
221	Of course , there are many types of high throughput technologies . We 're going to focus on technologies and data that are submitted to GEO , the gene expression omnibus .
222	The samples are applied in pairs . A sample from TNF plus and TNF minus mice is applied to each microarray .
223	Another technique uses cDNA cloning , where full length mRNA or messenger RNA is isolated and the corresponding cDNA sequence is deposited at NCBI .
224	If you 're feeling discomfort in your neck , if your chin 's up in the air , you might want to just put a pillow under your head because we want to make sure that the head is in line with the spine .
225	Breathe in . Now breathe out and roll up through your spine .
226	The leg just circles very carefully across the body and then you have the support of the band , so try to really relax in the hip area . Breathe in . Breathe out . Abdominals stay tight . Breath in and exhale out and across . Three . One more time .
227	Tighten the abdominals . Breathe in and keep it in and relax .
228	or whenever we really need the strength to avoid that excessive work through the lower back , that 's it .
229	They 're all good . I gotta it . I gotta it . My personal opinion is that they 're all good . Again , I dug into my soul .
230	These taste exactly the same as number one . They don 't . Mm . Hmm . What 's different to you ?
231	I could get lost in a bag of those . I would say that 's a Dorito .
232	Avoid touching your eyes , nose or mouth because germs can spread that way . For more information , visit www. cdc. gov or call 1-800
233	Hello , I 'm Dr. Tony Fiore with CDC 's influenza division . I 'm here to speak with you today about antiviral drugs that can be used to treat or prevent human infections with the new type of H1N1 flu virus , which has also been called swine flu .
234	It was a soul connection . Round two . Okay . Here we have four different corn chips , all shaped like long as toenail clippings .
235	Not these two . These could be Fritos . The real Fritos are in bowl number two .
236	Good boy . Hold on . Alright , Philly bear , time to put your dressing gown on .
237	Oh , I found another one that was hiding from Milo . For being a good <unk> . Oh Ooh . Okay .
238	Buddy , you did it . How long since last time ? I think it 's probably been at least two months .
239	I have to go back right now and see when was the last bath video . It was , at least , I would say , two , three months ago . When we actually washed him . Compare to when we put that video on . Yeah , it would have been a couple weeks
240	Good boy , Philly bear . Good boy . Finished . All over . Okay , it 's all over .
241	This program included lifestyle management such as weight , nutrition and stress management , along with smoking cessation and fitness , along with disease management components such as targeting participants with asthma , coronary heart disease , atrial fibrilation , heart failure , stroke , hyperlipidemia , low back pain and other issues .
242	The new survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that 36 % of firms with more than 200 workers and 18 % of firms over all , use financial incentives tied to health objectives like weight loss and smoking cessation .
243	The programs are generally not offered directly by insurance companies , but instead by specialist firms .
244	Hello everyone . This is Chef Saito . Welcome to my channel . Today I 'm gonna show you Japanese Wagyu Temaki Sushi Handroll .
245	okay , so ready to handroll . So now we 're gonna cook grill , so this one is very easy to cook .
246	so around this area . It 's really nice and texture . Okay , so nice part and nice flavor taste .
247	Okay . Sushi rice . Ok ? And then meat .
248	And what I wanted to do is explain where that naming system comes from , what it means and how it relates to the three types of influenza that exist , A , B and C.
249	And maybe this guy has the first type of H and the first type of N , and that would be H1N1 , and maybe this guy is H5N1 , or maybe this is H7
250	Are they the same ? Well , the answer is , no , they 're not necessarily the same .
251	I think you get the idea . Basically you just kind of name them based on the H and the N that they have on the outside .
252	is composed of smooth muscle , and just a bit of smooth muscle and a tunic entomb , basement membrane and endothelial cells .
253	So arteries go away from the heart also , and the veins go towards the heart . So what happens first is that . Let 's go over the arteries and veins , first , the names of the major arteries and veins .
254	Comes from the heart and as it goes to tissues such as skeletal muscle , for example<unk> It will branch into small arteries known as arterioles , which will then form capillaries .
255	Why is that ? Well , so it 's easy . So it 's easy for molecules of molecular exchange between capillaries and tissues .
256	An example of that would be Succinyl Choline mimics the neurotransmitter acetylcholine .
257	But an antagonist is a molecule that opposes the effect of a neurotransmitter , so it does the exact opposite , and an example of that would be curare , which is an antagonist to acetylcholine that can actually block the binding sites for acetylcholine .
258	and out here we have acetylcholine that wants to bind .
259	it wants to cause that channel to open , but it 's being blocked so that it cannot bind and it cannot open the channel for sodium to come in .
260	And we 're going to call this acetylcholine . When that comes here and it binds to the receptor , the same thing here comes and it binds to receptor .
261	So now it is effectively straight pipes when it 's open , and then we 've got just the muffler when it 's closed .
262	Here you can take a small boat to cross and hike up to the waterfall . The trip itself is beautiful , running through lush jungle mountains and occasional rice fields .
263	Definitely worth a visit if you are in Vang Vieng . It 's about five kilometer drive from the city and then 20 to 30 minutes to hike off the hill and your reward is this spectacular outlook over the area .
264	A great day trip from Luang Prabang is a visit to the Kuang Si Waterfall . You can book an organized trip or rent a scooter to drive up to the Nam Song River .
265	So first , let 's talk about how bile helps us digest fats . Whenever you eat food , your stomach will partially digest it and will turn into a substance called chyme .
266	And coming out , that gallbladder will be bile . It 'll go down through the cystic duct , then down through the common bile duct , and then it 'll hit the duodenum and it will help digest those fats that person just consumed .
267	Now what will happen to that bile is that now it will just drain down from the liver through the ducts , through the common bile duct , and hit the small intestine that 's duodenum cause that cystic duct that was coming off the gallbladder is tied off .
268	Look at that . Oh , look at that . It 's a double fold . See , i don 't think Lay 's actually do that double fold .
269	Again Link , your favorites were the Dollar General . Dollar General . I feel betrayed . Round three .
270	You ate two . I ate two of all of em . Oh , our sample size here .
271	Yes . What ? Hey . What ? The others were Great Value , Signature Select and Kroger .
272	number four . Hmm . I 've lost all perspective .
273	Okay , it 's time for the ultimate chip to dip . And the most underwhelming but helpful snack to bring to a party .
274	Okay . The Doritos are in bowl three . Yes . How did you know ? I knew that these were definitely not it .
275	Okay . Okay , here we go . Three , two , one . Bam . I 'm going with my initial instinct .
276	Not these two . These could be Fritos . The real Fritos are in bowl number two .
277	These are cheeseless . Oh my gosh , they 're not good . Ah , that tastes like , are you sure that 's just not a packing peanut ?
278	Then Fritos , then Great Value from Walmart and then Clover Valley from Dollar General . Fritos are so much darker than anyone ever thought .
279	Three , two , one . All right , so you agree . Yeah . And that was my scent assessment as well as taste .
280	Alright , the Fritos thing really threw me off . I don 't know if there 's a bend to em or not . Okay , here we go .
281	Yeah , that 's horrible . I think that might be actual styrofoam . And what about these ? More cheese ? They 're better than the first ones , but I wouldn 't binge on those .
282	You were close , but it 's got to be three , right ? The Lay 's original chips are in bowl number four .
283	And to find out where the wheel of mythicality 's gonna land . Need some new accessories for your pup ? Look no further than a mythical pattern pack for pups .
284	Tostitos ' tortilla chips . Now , if I asked you before looking at these to describe Tostitos , what would you say is a hallmark of that chip ?
285	I don 't ever look at my food . I just eat it . I just open the bag and i eat it . These are darker .
286	Oh , this is distinctly different . That is not a Dorito . Oh , we 're competing . I shouldn 't tell you that . That 's a Dorito .
287	The former has said that it does plan to keep Air transat in its current form for the foreseeable future , which is all well because Air transat ‚Äò s club class for any traveler is a great option .
288	There was a wide variety of newly released films , both in English and French . There was also a good variety of TV shows and offer anyone to be satisfied on a longer flight .
289	Air transat definitely knows its customers as there was an extensive kid section with enough content to keep them busy for quite a few flights .
290	I 'm thoroughly impressed . I paid 288 Canadian dollars for this one-way one-hour flight , a price that is comparable to what a flex economy ticket would cost with air Canada or WestJet on the same route .
291	I just . Again , I never look . It just goes . Now that 's a good one . Finally , we 're getting to the good stuff now .
292	Our job is to identify the Fritos . I 've had a lot of Fritos in my life , but I 've never , really .
293	This sucks . This is not Doritos . This is not anything i want to taste again .
294	Clover Valley . So Kroger is doing a really good job . And Kroger did a really good job with some other test we did .
295	These are short and stubby , and these are longer and C 'd . C 'd ?
296	I 'm not actually touching . Hmm . That 's a good Frito in number one slot .
297	Three , two , one . Okay . And i thought there was a bend , but these taste better , so i 'm going .
298	I don 't think I can tell you . Sure you can . You think they 're better ? I don 't think I can tell you . Now
299	Number two taste a lot better than I. Ugh , not good . That number two slot is jinxed . Huh .
300	You were prepared for us to tie . Isn 't that cute ? Wow . Okay , this is awesome .
301	That 's a good chip , though . Yeah , it is . Moving on over here . That one 's different .
302	Bodeg√≥n . I 'm getting used to his words . Sorry . Bodeg√≥n . I 'm used to saying Bodega . But Bodeg√≥n is alright .
303	I mean , it depends on the quality you want , but you can get this stuff at a really , really , really , really low price . Guys , we have found the mother of the bottles .
304	They work stories of that , actually , but check it out . Everything is really stuck over here .
305	So for example , adding a P<unk> A<unk> N. over here , the staple of Venezuela food , this is right here .
306	Alright guys , so these are the beers that they have over here . Zulia , Heineken .
307	This one here puts that one ashamed . Number four . They 're solid too .
308	I don 't know , freakin ' , I don 't freakin ' know . These three are . I feel like I know . I 'm making an educated guess .
309	So those are your favorite , Link . Those are good . Then Market Pantry from Target . They didn 't taste good . Then Doritos and then Great Value from Walmart .
310	I , I thought that . Yeah . We need some chili up in here . That would help .
311	Do store brands have more game than i thought ? It 's time for knockoff knockout chips edition .
312	That is yummy. looks like a tartar sauce .
313	Mom . I 'll give you that one off it , but everything else is kind of the same . It 's any other Mcchicken you expect to find , except for the huge price .
314	So as you can see , the grand total is 187<unk> 85 Bolivars . Once we go to our app over here , we put it in , we run it off to 188 , and that equals forty three dollars USD .
315	But yeah , overall I 'm not convinced . 13 or 14 bucks for this sandwich here . So here is my receipt .
316	The beef patty is like a slice of cheese .
317	All right ? Cool , cool . Do you have any work experience ?
318	You 're looking for a job and you don 't even have a resume ? All right , after this video , I want you to take a look at my very first video .
319	Oh yeah . And oh , it 's cool It 's quite
320	The collar is missing . Oh yeah , it 's totally missing . You 're right . Yeah , quite down .
321	And only those things are 20 . These ones are five . Oh , so this is five . That 's five .
322	Yeah , that 's cool . I really love the embroidery . I know . It 's really pretty and the fact that it looks really old .
323	I 'm starting to like them more than you , i think . I don 't know if this is old though . Oh , look , it looks .
324	Do it again . You feel that catch ? You feel how it feels on your back foot ?
325	Whoa . That 's not the worst board . That might be the best board . You got a trick for us . Sure . First try .
326	Oh , yeah , shove it , Lance may or may not pull through on this .
327	This one 's got a darker flavor , like a darker corn flavor . Oops . Mmm .
328	Daddy 's coming . Daddy 's coming .
329	Say bye to park . Press the horn to make them go faster .
330	If one goes , the other will bolt and it 's just easier to control . If you 've got the two good dogs off lead , that you can control .
331	Buddy 's pulling , yay ! Bye , park , bye !
332	Buddy ! Time to go home . Buddy .
333	grew to billions of times the mass of our sun . By launching powerful jets , they heated up the regions surrounding their host galaxies .
334	Astronomers spotted the answer in a flash of gamma radiation in the direction of the center of our galaxy . Radio telescopes zeroed in on the source .
335	To find out how stars shape our universe , astronomers are employing an arsenal of new technology , from giant telescopes perched on high mountains ,
336	It 's enveloped in immense hot cavities , glowing in x ray light .
337	Man . Which one of these would you want ? Just sitting here , eating chips and confusing myself . Mm . Hmm . Especially after so much flavor in the other rounds .
338	Cue 3d printing laser cutting build montage . Hello .
339	so that our ball tub can sit above our bed . And now all we need to do is work out how we 're gonna control it .
340	So we finished wiring and all we need to do now is to paint it , install it and fill it with some balls .
341	It 's fitted . And if you don 't get out of bed in time , this is what happens .
342	And if you don 't want that to happen , you need to hold down the big red button . I know this is how the invention is supposed to work , but it 's so much more fun when it causes a mess .
343	You need the lead ? Where 's Phil going ? Right , wait Phil , hold on , Phil , come here , come here , Phil .
344	At the right now . I am going to go through all the headset specs , while letting you know my impressions and test results .
345	Now . What i did notice is that the headset gets hot when turned on for a longer time .
346	In my opinion , this design is outdated , but it does compensate by being one of the most comfortable headsets out there .
347	Now they do break though as the first Vive Pro had a lot of screen door effect and it 's just outdated .
348	As for the microphone well , integrated dual microphones and unfortunately not improved .
349	So because this is in the elastic range , it means that the more I push on it , the more bends it has , the more force I have to put on it to do the next bend .
350	Look at this . But then release it , immediately goes back .
351	So when you give it some force , it compresses back together and then you can elongate it .
352	Whoa . So you can see where we deformed it . We went past the elastic limit . So this device is meant to not let it go past that elastic deformation point , so that it doesn 't leave any permanent creases in it .
353	Now , a lot of that has to do with the instability in the ends of it , so the initial conditions of the crush .
354	How old are you ? Nineteen . How old are you ? Twenty six . Think we could still be friends ?
355	Smoking 's upstairs to your left . Smoking 's upstairs . Hey , ray , is dolly parton giving you a percentage of the profit ?
356	Six more payments , gentlemen . And this beautiful blue four door luxury sedan is all mine .
357	But in terms of his health , he is fine , He 's just chill Phil is how I would describe him and his fur is It is what it is , is all I can say about that .
358	I feel like in the last , probably , let 's say , six months ago , there was a rapid spread of , of Alopecia .
359	And I feel like I 've scrubbed that floor , I polish it , you know , I feel like maybe he got his scent because it 's always in a certain spot , so I keep washing it and washing it and like trying to put anti marking sprays up and lemon juice .
360	Today we thought we 'd film a bit of a life update . We 've had quite a few questions on some recent videos , so we thought we 'd do a bit of an update for where everything is .
361	Keep it up and we 're slowly rotating up here . Little circles forward for ten , nine , eight , seven , six , five , four , three , two and one .
362	We want to target everything , so finding the right direction is very important .
363	Your eyes are following , looking up to your hand to the ceiling , or .
364	Chest is wide open , length into the leg , four , three , two and one , and slowly come back down .
365	and walk over to the right . Same thing . Inhale through the nose , exhale through the mouth .
366	Did you just tell me to go away ? Oh , it 's not open then .
367	There 's some there . There 's three behind you . Thank you mummy .
368	Come on , Teddy . ( She 's slinky . ) Is Niko slinky ? ( Can chunk and stuff it . ) Come on , chunky . ( Come on . Nico , come on , under . ) Yeah , come on , come on .
369	Hello , snow . Mia , say , " Teddy , come on ! " Teddy , come here !
370	And then down , and then up . Come on , up ! ( Too cold . ) Too cold , is it .
371	They 're better than first ones , but i wouldn 't binge all those . Look at the diameter .
372	I 've had a lot of fritos in my life , but I 've never , really , I don 't ever look at my food . I just eat it . I just open the bag and i eat it .
373	It 's Lay 's dorito 's and it just hit me when I ate them and that 's what I went with . It was a soul connection . Round two .
374	Okay , you ready ? No , hahaha , you ready . You 're eating everything .
375	We have some star anise , which actually is in a little tiger dish , so we are celebrating the year of the tiger with our star anise .
376	We have her on the baby monitor so we can check in on her , make sure she 's doing okay .
377	Let 's go back to the stove , bring out the wok and start getting some heat .
378	We are going to place some of these beautiful shredded pepper . It 's like , it 's like a piece of art .
379	Yeah , that 'd be cool . Unk . Bye . Happy new year .
380	the castings look really nice , really clean , really smooth . No casting flash anywhere .
381	Now . The car actually belongs to a really good friend who 's a mechanic , also a hill climb racing champion .
382	They 're just nice . So yeah , i guess that 's pretty much it for this little announcement video .
383	When it comes to inline four engines , you usually fit side draft carburetors which are attached to the engine like this .
384	Tiny signs of grinding right here , but i have seen that , pretty much every idea of carburetor i have ever seen .
385	It may be sad to possibly say goodbye to a show that gave me so many goosebumps , and tears , but , i 'm more than thankful that we have born this masterful adaptation to see the series through .
386	Being a fan of the series , and someone who 's followed the manga all the way to its conclusion , you can bet i 'm excited as hell for this one .
387	All you need to do is sign up , answer a questionnaire , and the service will quickly link you to a therapist within 48 hours .
388	And if you think things aren 't working out for you , you can easily switch therapists free of charge . All you need to do , is to check out the link in the description or go to betterhelp .
389	I can 't believe it 's already been 20 years . It 's like A few minutes later the Microsoft , Google , Facebook , and finally here .
390	Yeah . I 'm going to recursively call this helper method to build a sub <unk> <unk> . What are the l and r represent ? Here , the l and r are used to represent .
391	You skied it . We haven 't . Okay , i skied in like two years . I never have .
392	What 's up ? What do you see there ? Well , if you 're not doing it , i ain 't doing it .
393	That 's a committing line , too , because there 's a cliff below you , right ? But that was good .
394	Oh shit . It 's not that good . Whoa .
395	Okay , we 're done . Royal racing . Tons of fun . It 's obviously dead quiet here . There 's people up in the hotel rooms , but what a night .
396	Some amazing . How many people have got eighty series land cruises ago those events come and have a chat and say hello and stuff like that and people asking stuff like what 's the bonnet and bits and pieces ?
397	Well , i was a bit , but not apes . So yeah , pretty cool . Bit of fun . I 'm sure this thing is bloody loud though .
398	Classy ladylike vibe . We are wearing matching tops . I think there is like 13 colors to choose from if i 'm not wrong . Yeah . It 's damn mad . Okay so . Guess guess guess . Okay you only have saggittarius and leo left so there 's only two . It 's a 50-50 chance . Obiviously .
399	When you find an awesome plastic enclosure , you buy five of them , and then when you come home , you find out that they are stickers on them that won 't come off .
400	I hope that it 's not too hot . Step 2 . Put some vegetable oil onto a paper towel until it 's saturated , and scrub the section with the glue pretty fast .
401	Need to remove the label first . Let 's see if this works slowly , but surely it is taking down the glue .
402	Now that 's the post that I need . It was posted by 14 pokis , and he explained how he used vegetable oil to remove the glue .
403	Who does that ? Come on , stop . It was still hot .
404	Is that your motorbike fund ? That Mia 's motorbike fund ?
405	Should be thankful for him . Buddy ?
406	What do you think of all this , Milo , this savageness . But he 's saving you from Teddy .
407	Honestly , it 's just getting dizzy , watching them . Buddy 's head must be all over the place .
408	Teddy 's best friend , look . You can 't go over to them though , they 're playing .
409	So with its stock foam . Well , except foam part more about that later . I also use my Valve Index controllers , and I use it with the valve base stations 2<unk> 0 Oh , now let 's move on to setup first .
410	That pairs with the high price . It 's hard to recommend it as other headsets provide better value for the price .
411	Well , i know this here and this is interesting . G2 's display is sharper and has a little less motion blur .
412	But this is always a nice feature for quick peeks at your real life surroundings . However , this may impact performance .
413	However I 'm a noob , so I bought the wrong one . So for now , you just gotta trust my words .
414	You can get six months or twelve month dose and it 's like a microchip that is a chemical castration . It goes into their body , same as like a female , you know .
415	Take him to the vet . Yeah , should we go ? Yeah . Come on then . What did you say ? Teddy 's what ?
416	There we go . Right . This is his fur patch where he saw the bleeding .
417	Back , out , out , out , out . So does Teddy want to go ?
418	Tell him a secret . It 's okay . I think he knows it 's you .
419	Like how ? How ? Blast it back on back .
420	He almost like his back , almost land on the corner . This is one of those things I can 't do in front of a lot of people .
421	He 's going really fast . No way he 's going so fast . He makes fast people look not fast .
422	You 're insane . Faster . Okay , only Fetty , dude .
423	Oh , my god , land it . All right , move on to the five area .
424	there 's a car coming and a cake about to arrive . Okay , got a few crumbs there , ruth .
425	This is what we used for our pie dropping device , and it will allow our food to go along and drop into the person 's mouth .
426	kids invent stuff orange . What are you so interested in , luna ?
427	I have eaten so much cake . It 's a speed test .
428	So we 've just built a frame to attach the little wheel on the front of the bike . Sean is just trying it out while we 've tack welded it to see if we should fully commit .
429	Okay , all right , friend , you ready ? We have two people to take down next .
430	Oh my gosh . Promotion promotions . Oh my gosh . Okay , now get out of my sight .
431	Okay , my pride is on the line is my friends find out from school . Oh , no , we have to go beat him .
432	I 'm so proud of you . You really showed to me that you could be such a good pok 'mon trainer . Look , oh , you 've got Littenbach and Turtwig up .
433	You 're great at puns too . Don 't take that away from me . I need something .
434	Sometimes it 's one person shielding , the other person 's intruding . Sometimes one person 's withdrawing , so the person 's like , oh okay , i can 't engage right now . The other person 's casing intruding or maybe the person 's shielding , there 's different permutations variations of these different intentions .
435	Stuff parents can still be proud of in a weird way . And to the graduating class of 2017 , minus three .
436	And when the door opens in real life , just walk through it . And don 't worry if you miss your cue because there 's always doors opening , they keep opening .
437	because everything you gain in life will rot and fall apart , and all that will be left of you is what was in your heart .
438	Hahaha . Once that button is functioning in your life , there 's no story that the mind could create that will be as compelling .
439	But even with that comes a feeling of divine dissatisfaction . Because ultimately , we are not the avatars we create .
440	Yeah i 'm taking break . One more . No I 'm taking break . One more . I 'm taking . One more . This is it . This is the one . No hesitation . Ah I got in your head . Well again we 're here for do some stuff and found some time to practice the move .
441	Done for today and yeah let 's work and do some different stuff . Thank you sir . You 're welcome in . Well the four and sorenest went from one side of the leg towards all legs and a little bit on the lower back and shoulders .
442	I did like one or two moves and I completely destroyed my arms so the attachment here . Wait a second . So my attachments of brachioradialis in bicep , when you grab and absorb , was so was so inflamed and I was I was completely destroyed .
443	So second set . That was almost full commit .
444	Here you go , trouble . Can you watch over him for me ?
445	These two sleepy heads . I think Niko is still on that table <unk> . Oh , Milo 's coming , hold on . Somebody , Milo sees puppy in his spot , That 's usually where he would be next to Amelia .
446	Hello , Phil . Hello , Phil . Oh , look at Niko .
447	Where ? He 's hiding ! Should we knock on the window ?
448	What you showing , buddy ? Your bott bott ( bottle ) .
449	You need Lagos brand paper towels , the most absorbent paper towel available . Husbands can use it too you know . But then the 2000 's hit and suddenly it 's just like . Feeling depressed . I 'm sorry , I just love how to start off like .
450	And so now I have to save the world aka new york city , using my new pachetti powers and relatably quirky personality . But here we are , finally getting something different . Oh I brought my pet rabbit for your magic act . Yes of course , thank you Agnes .
451	except vision . There 's no family , no husband . Well , there 's nothing wrong with her . No home . What do you mean she has no home ? She came here because we 're all ‚Ä¶ She came here because we 're all what ? What are you trying to tell me ?
452	Right behind it , the action 's happening . Oh , did you get pushed ?
453	Now they are yeah . I just think they just think they 're brothers . Oh , Niko 's at <unk> . oh , Niko 's . Where is Niko ?
454	Give you one more minute . Oh , Teddy , big baby !
455	Teddy , get up ! Show him who 's boss ! Oh , it 's getting funnier .
456	Here they come again , wait for the Nik 's . Oh , Niko .
457	Did you do it ? Did you do it ?
458	Why is your paw dirty , Teddy ? Teddy , what 's this on your paw ?
459	Come here , Amelia . Come to daddy . Dirty !
460	Teddy , naughty ! Teddy , come here . Teddy , come on .
461	No ? Was it you ? Did Amelia do it ? ! Did you do that ? Are you covering up for Teddy ?
462	As the pressure drops more and more , it completely changes shape now . Look at it just hanging down completely now .
463	Now that 's a pretty bold claim . What that means is that if I were to do this in a vacuum chamber , the string wouldn 't lift up like this , it would just stay hanging down , even though the loop is still spinning .
464	But why would it do that , how does drag make it lift up ? If you have a really heavy string , then it 's going to be dominated by the weight of the string , so the string 's gonna hang down like this .
465	So the faster you spin it , the easier it is to lift itself up . But the reason that is , is because it 's still dependent on drag force , so the faster you spin it , the more drag it has , the easier it can lift itself up .
466	Okay , so first let 's start this off at atmospheric pressure , so I 'm going to turn up the voltage here . It easily rises at only four volts here .
467	I mean , i mean , the thing is , is that i am American . No matter how long I live abroad , you know , I 'm always going to be American .
468	But look at his response . No . The answer to the question is that people buy into my agenda . The answer to the question is people buy into my agenda .
469	And now we 're quite frankly , we 're happy we 're in Canada because Canada has pretty much all the good things from America and all the bad things you have in America we don 't have here .
470	To be a publicly elected official in America , you need a lot of money . That 's how the system works .
471	And this has to be a change , this has to be a tipping point for America and we 're gonna be using this platform to be invoking this change , that we need to see in the world .
472	There you go . Go and push , Milo , push ! Good , Amelia .
473	And now i 'll put his tail in . There you go , now you can push him . Milo , you are an angel .
474	Put your hand away , I 've got that , thank you . Perfect , well done !
475	They 're gonna help you . Just tear it Mia . Oh ! What 's in there ?
476	Gonna put the pillow under baby 's head ? What about baby 's pillow ? There it is , look , is this baby 's pillow ?
477	Okay , here we go . It 's all the way throttle . Oh , I can 't keep it up even all the way throttled .
478	I set it on the floor and I take off . Does that mean the drone is just going to shoot to the back of the plane ?
479	Okay , here we go . Okay . Not touching it . Oh , oh gosh Hi
480	When actuality , the drone is just staying right where it was . Now , after seeing this experiment , you might start confusing yourself .
481	Better , it is applied in two layers and i forgot how long it took to dry entirely , but for the high resolution , i used a two component mixture .
482	First , i had to impregnate the entire wall in order for the hydro insulation layer to adheit .
483	And here we are now , the actual enclosure building . The first phase of the actual enclosure building can start , and it will start with me building a wall .
484	If you are , make sure to comment something and like this video . If you want to support this channel , you know there 's a patreon page .
485	We have it ready for the waterfall , because the waterfall will flow from top all the way down .
486	Teddy , go on ! Go on ! Run away . Atleast he 's not aggresive about food .
487	Teddy look , I 've got him . Are you gonna eat it ?
488	I 'm gonna put him down ! Wait , that 's the little fish thing , It 's not even eaten .
489	Buddy , Buddy ! Aww , you guys !
490	It 's because we gave him a treat about twenty minutes ago and he isn 't eating it , he 's just holding it in his mouth , trying to get a minute to eat it .
491	What about this ? This is a beautiful instrument , mr . Hammond .
492	Thank you , major Arms , for everything . I think you better take this with you . You might need it . You 're back , major .
493	Pick it out . Horses , mules , oxen . All in the pin there . Just name it . Come on now , mike , where 's your good stuff ?
494	He shot bill . He murdered him . It 's a fair fight . That 's right , Joke . The man only fired after Bill shot first .
495	I know that major and I appreciate it , but I have nothing to keep me here now and I don 't want to drop out the lives of the others .
496	The light just passes right through it . But what if the air wasn 't transparent ? What if it was opaque and it absorbed the light instead to let it pass through ?
497	Okay , so I have my copper at the bottom here , then we 're going to add some nitric acid to it .
498	When I release my latest video and check out action lab shorts , which is my second channel that I have . That 's similar to this one , but I do my videos in less than a minute and thanks for watching and I 'll see you next time .
499	When you pour nitric acid on copper , it forms something called nitrogen dioxide .
500	It doesn 't seem like this should work , but it works . You can see an illustration of a spin one half particle using this belt trick here .
501	The reason this happens is because electrons are what we call spin one half particles .
502	What 's cool about Betterhelp is you can log into your account anytime and send a message to your therapist .
503	You can see the spinning square attached by belts here , or a more extreme example with a ton of belts .
504	It 's not a crisis line , it 's not self help , it 's actually professional therapy done securely online .
505	It gets hot here at the top and here so you will feel it when you play vr2 .
506	The first vive pro is now discontinued in favor of this one . If you buy the vive pro 2 headset only , it will cost you 800 us dollars .
507	Yes , this is pretty noticeable and it will take time getting used to. however , when using the thin vr cover , it was way better .
508	We hope you enjoyed it as much as we made in making it . Any excuse for a snow day , hey ?
509	Here you go , Phil . Good boy ! You can all get one because I think I got the shot anyway , okay ?
510	Phil , you ready ? This one 's for you , don 't let Teddy get it . Did Teddy get it ?
511	Look at him . You scared me !
512	Or do you want to bounce ? No . We 've got snow dogs , Amelia , you 're gonna have to learn to like the snow .
513	Two and one . Good rest .
514	Got it in five , four , three , two time .
515	Alright , you have 30 second rest . Then we 're gonna go into some bands . So let 's start right here .
516	Three , two , one . Let 's hit it . Finishing strong .
517	And come right here . Jump here . Jump . Let 's get it .
518	Every time he played a shot , there were no two shots the same . When you 're talking about Rallies , you must be talking about last game .
519	Yeah , two shots ago , I mean , two serves ago . Zhendong just moved and hit the winner . Right ? So <unk> <unk> .
520	I thought Jeoung Youngsik played this so well . He gets one back , turns the racket around .
521	The ball clipped the net , but that actually went against , against him , because he just stood up , and Youngsik could play the winner .
522	I think that 's one of the lovely things about a lot of these players , but Jeoung Youngsik specifically , he 's got a very light sort of vibe about him , but in the Korean spirit , fights very hard representing his country .
523	I don 't know , you tell me , but i believe that it 's some of the best i have . Honestly check it out , guys . We 're trying to break up the venezuelan polar .
524	In the name of god . This song is for you .
525	I gotta finish this and see if i end up kidnapped somewhere on one of these keys .
526	There ‚Äô s the polar . Santa teresa . It ‚Äô s frozen . It 's delicious . That one ‚Äô s cold. cheers . What do we do with this one ?
527	Guys , it 's very important . He watches a lot of you so you can tell . So this is a It has a lot of fruits from here in as well .
528	I 'm really excited to explore this one . It 's in the south of France and this place has been abandoned for 35 years .
529	If you liked the video , please like , subscribe if you 're new to the channel , and do not miss any explorations .
530	And at a certain point in the evening on her 23rd year of life , she was lying in this bed , probably under the influence of drugs , alcohol and other things .
531	As you can see . Michelle , no , it 's Annalise . Of course , Michelle was the man .
532	Wow . Let 's go further .
533	Today i 'm going to share with you eight different badminton warm up valley routine . Number one drive shot requires smaller swing but more focus .
534	It 's great for rotating your body smoothly and relaxing your muscles . Number four .
535	Due to the speed of the shot compared to others . It 's great for warm up your wrists and fingers and also increase your focus .
536	Number seven . Net push can warm up your front court again and serve receive shot .
537	Number two . Clear shot will make your body rotate . Therefore warming up your back muscles and shoulders . Clear shot could also get you used to the air flow of the courts .
538	I don 't know how accurate that 4000 number is , but if it 's true , I could fly for a lot longer .
539	I 'm gonna drop my throttle now and see how the plane does with altitude . Okay , throttles dropped .
540	I think up there there could be some ridge lift , so , might cruise up there and check it out . Amazing .
541	You can take them really low . So yeah , I could probably fly this plane for close to twice as long or more .
542	Looks like I 'm slowly losing altitude . Is not super surprising because it is dead calm here on the ground , so there 's probably not really any ridge lift going on up there , but it 's still really pretty .
543	So this is a potential pitfall area . Correct ? Because if you do it too short when you turn your bars , your dropper post could go down .
544	As long as you 're not pushing the lever , it 's not going anywhere . Yeah , it stays in place in theory . At the end of this video , we 'll go through some common dropper post problems , that often arise after you install the dropper post , or after you change the cable housing .
545	All right , there 's the cable that 's more like it . Now you want to push the dropper post into the bike , while you pull the housing from the other side .
546	This is sid 's favorite task ever . Well , these are better . Oh , yeah . Shall we look at that ?
547	Cool . Okay , so now pull on the cable hard . Make sure it 's all the way through .
548	Here is a terrible system because the bottom is actually very flat and it 's no .
549	What do you plan for the future of your youtube channel ? Well , when i completed this greenland expedition , i 'm going to go home and edit it , of course , and make five or six episodes of it .
550	Going down here . Then you can steer the hydrome rudder with this . Just set the course on. so it 's like a third way of steering the boat , the third automatic way of steering the boat .
551	No , it 's like , just maybe the down thing with the boat .
552	Excuse you . Oh , my goodness . You 're so optimistic , buddy .
553	I see . I watched uh <unk> <unk> . You two a little bit . He 's just trying to get Teddy 's back leg .
554	Shane , we need to move that away from them . Thanks . Oh .
555	Do he try to steal your dummy . Teddy , don 't let him .
556	Oh , oh . Oh . That serves you right , Teddy .
557	So these color changes should start to seem familiar to some of you . If you look at the visible color spectrum , you 'll notice that it goes from violet to red .
558	Hey , everybody , today I 'm going to be showing you what happens when you put LED 's or even laser diodes in liquid nitrogen .
559	Right , let 's all go to sleep then . Night night ! Mama 's here .
560	Good night , my princess . Love you ! Pardon ?
561	Just need Niko and Phil , we 've got full house . This is a new normal now , by the way guys , that we have to lay on the floor with Mia , until she falls asleep .
562	Buddy come on . Come on . Oh , don 't shut the <unk> . no , let him in !
563	Night , night , love you ! Mummy 's going to sleep now , with Buddy and Teddy .
564	I know he 'll be running right with him soon , because Milo is just a confident <unk> <unk> . cat , and <unk> <unk> .
565	Hi . Um <unk> <unk> . but yeah , Milo is not taken to him . Niko 's doing good . Teddy obviously is doing really good .
566	And we got Buddy for Ella . Because , it 's just <unk> <unk> . she just at that age where <unk> <unk> . you know , she needs a dog .
567	And , yeah , this is Buddy , her dog . So he 'll be around every weekend , just like Claude sometimes is on our channel , and <unk> <unk> .
568	Okay , it 's an addiction . But yeah , I thought I did a bit of a story time about how Buddy came to join our family .
569	So having the diopter dialed for each eye , the people that need it can get better visual clarity .
570	So let 's talk about the specs . The VIVE Flow works like this . It connects wirelessly to your 5G Android smartphone .
571	Viveport Infinity will also get a new monthly subscription service called VISTA , where you pay a couple of bucks per month to get access to their entire mobile games library unlimited .
572	Yes , unfortunately , it doesn 't work on iPhones just yet , but it uses the Android phone to stream content via Miracast .
573	The HTC VIVE was my first VR headset , and back then they brought epic things that no other company had .
574	Last time Ghost didn 't provide enough food for them and Willow had to do most of the work . I don 't think she 'll want this to happen again . Barn Owls lay their eggs two to three days apart .
575	The third and final egg is laid . She 'll spend the next 30 days incubated . I can 't wait to watch a story unfold .
576	If the food source is there , barn owls have been documented to lay in any month of the year . But they usually hold off until spring . On the 19th of january the kestrels returned to sycamore again .
577	Next time , watch as new life starts to emerge . And this barn owl pair battled the elements to provide for their new chicks . Fierce winter storms . Thank you for watching and i hope you enjoyed the video .
578	This is our in kilometer right here. and then the the gas pedal is a little tricky on this stuff .
579	Why does nobody ever name their vehicle a , he . This is not pretty enough for a she . I don 't think .
580	You won 't need all three seconds for sure . You guys catch it .
581	I think i 'm somewhere around , like 17 pounds of boost or something . It 'll hit that and then as soon as you let go of this , it 'll launch .
582	It 's do a pretend 40 roll . One , two , three , go .
583	So currently in the car if you 're not familiar with the channel currently on this 340 all wheel drive , we have a countless down pipe , we have safe , full cat back exhaust , we have a most intake , we have the Kies charge pipe and then the boot mode .
584	And then , of course i 'll show you us actually using it in the car and it is sick . So first of all , if you have not tuned your car or anything like that , this is being ran under protruding freaks boot mode .
585	That means you can create a really tight fit when attaching your camera . For added security of the camera and grip , it comes with a hand strap as well .
586	So many people have asked me on this channel what selfie stick I recommend that 's waterproof . And this is the only one that I know of , that has being waterproof as one of its main features .
587	To unlock it , you simply twist the top and it clicks three times , and then you have a selfie stick that extends to 22 inches .
588	The Nu Grip has four functions in one bit of kit . It 's a hand grip , an extendable selfie stick , a tripod , and it floats on water .
589	I 've recommended this Nu Grip 4 in 1 selfie stick tripod to a lot of people before even owning one myself .
590	Oh , okay . Oh , Teddy wants it , look ! Where are you going with your car , Amelia ?
591	Run , Amelia ! Well , that 's Phil 's tactic .
592	Ready . Go get it , go on ! Phil , Phil , get it .
593	Amelia , come here . Sit , sit , sit , stay .
594	Is it ready ? Is it ready , yeah ? Leave .
595	And here we 've got some beautiful broccoli again which has done slightly better . Actually that does make an interesting comparison . I think the fleece is slightly warmer than the muslin . The muslin is still working well . The issue with the muslin is that because it does degrade .
596	Not so much about warmth , particularly this one because this is mesh and it 's a nylon weave tight close , small enough holes to keep insects out , pests off . It 's on here because of potential pigeon damage .
597	And normally I don 't use hoops because when you put a cover on hoops like this you can see how the wind 's blowing it . It means the wind can get under it a bit . And that sometimes you know this is a moderate when it 's not a strong wind .
598	Put it back in the bowl . Add in just a little oil , just a few drops .
599	Let 's divide this into orange sized balls . Let 's begin on the worktop with a little bit of flour .
600	Bring it all together . Pinch this like a large Momo .
601	Do not get tempted to add in all the water at one go , you 'll end up with a sticky dough . Let 's start bringing all of this together .
602	Phil , do you want to play with the baby ? Yeah , it does . Here you go , baby .
603	Milo running away from his responsibility . Look , hold it like daddy 's little baby , like this , Amelia 's little baby , and then your daddy 's little baby , Amelia 's little baby .
604	Then what about Milo ? It 's the treacherous trap of lego .
605	Phil 's got a baby , Milo 's got a baby , Teddy 's got a baby . Are you Niko 's baby ? Is Amelia , Niko 's baby .
606	So I can hold baby , you hold the camera so that they can see . You hold it like that . There we go . Thanks , Mia .
607	There 's a birthday here , so everybody 's coming . I like your Miami purse very much . I lived there . That ‚Äô s my city . I see . Yes let ‚Äô s go . Wanna go check out the the baseball field we 're gonna .
608	And this salad is just really refreshing . How much is it my friend ? How much was it in total ? The total ? It 's 2000 , two dollars . Two dollars . Yes . All right . Here ‚Äô s five . The change is for you . Thanks a lot . I haven ‚Äô t yet tried the chicken .
609	Guys , first look outside and . And let 's .
610	There ‚Äô s a lot of people there . Looks better around here . Thanks a lot . This is how it is here , guys .
611	All right . Talk to me , brother . How ‚Äô s baseball here ? How does this work here ? This league ? Explain for the people that don ‚Äô t know . For people that don ‚Äô t know about Venezuela . They think it ‚Äô s a south American country . And it ‚Äô s only about football .
612	There 's really old clothes lived so it 's like the batcave for old clothes . Hello and welcome back to my channel today going to be productive responsible very good .
613	folks ? This is , well , it 's solid , but we 've had a serious reaction to something .
614	Don 't worry , folks , don 't worry , these are old jeans . I mean , look , there 's rips all over .
615	Oh , this looks amazing . The patterns in this is coming out really , really nice , so hopefully this will be a little bit of a better result than the last one .
616	I mean , luckily enough , it didn 't make too much mess , but look at like it 's like , leaked out the blue in the DENIM .
617	It works except currently there is a bug , and it only works with the steamvr beta . But to turn this on , you have to go in Steam settings .
618	To this date , steamvr tracking , is still the most accurate and best tracking mechanisms amongst vr headsets .
619	But before i give you the measurements , please keep in mind that the exact number i 'm giving you is personal , and this really depends on subjective things like my face shape .
620	Really , really young . So i thought i 'd show bally the actual the music video for us , and then we 'll go to the television show , and then we 'll obviously check out the lyrics , so we can all sort of see what they 're .
621	Your world is a castle . Fill the photo sticker with heart symbols . That 's great . And stick it on your mobile .
622	How fun though . Oh my god , she 's stunning . Good looking woman . Jesus , that skincare routine .
623	I will say yes to anything you want , cindy , i really do love you . So . And then their reply is , if you suddenly sneeze , that must be because i 'm thinking of you .
624	Well done . I don 't know <unk> <unk> . here you go Amelia . Say " yay ! " Good boy !
625	Daddy won ! I need to go to dentist . Look !
626	Buddy wins ! Did she do it ?
627	Pull ! Good boy , Buddy !
628	Pull ! Yay ! Did you make him sit ?
629	Blow out the candle going inward . You can see that it truly is sucking in air and blowing it out , because if I move the candle in different places , you can see that in some places it 's sucking in the fire .
630	When it sucks it in , it comes from all directions around the tube and so there 's no one area around it that 's having a lot of air passed by it .
631	So you can see the difference between sucking and blowing here . So I have a cotton ball in my hand and watch what happens when I hold it a few inches from the outlet of the blower .
632	But when you get it in the right spot with the air coming out , that air is all moving in the same direction , so there 's a lot more bulk of air in a small area to blow out the candle .
633	When you turn it on , it makes this sound as if this fan starts turning and blowing air out of it , so let 's see if it actually works to blow out a candle .
634	So in the end of this video , i 'd like to thank you for being with me today , and hopefully you 've learned something new and it was fun .
635	Both of the results are captured , while the robots are operating in their normal mode , and Rubber Rock even has a carpet mode switched on , which consumes a bit more battery .
636	Speaking of improvement ideas in drawbacks , i would add the motor efficiency , the really noisy maximum section mode and the lack of carpet mode .
637	There is one more observation to make . I believe the motor used by ILIFE is not that efficient because it consumes almost 2 percent battery per square meter , whereas Rubber Rock S5 in the same environment , will consume less than one percent per square meter .
638	And i 'll tell you something very important about it in the next minutes . In terms of navigation , the robot is also very decent because it counts on lidar , and vslam both .
639	For many of us , saying goodbye to things can be uneasy , and sometimes we just want to take the easy way out , and convince ourselves that every single item that we own , has a place in our life that gets us nowhere in all cluttering .
640	Is there a problem we are trying to solve , or pain points you are trying to address through simplifying your life <unk>
641	Just one are of many examples . Some people think that we can 't be called minimalists because our home is not small enough , and that 's totally fine with us .
642	While we are less of a fan of is the idea of wastage , our own wastage was something that we had to come to terms with , as we went through everything we had in our possession , in the process of simplifying our lives .
643	The cluttering , the removing of things from our lives , is the password that gets all the attention .
644	Daddy help , get him warm quickly . I put it up here and make Phil warm .
645	Go speak to him . Phil . Phil , get in bath .
646	Phil 's old . Let him stay inside the wall . You can stay on that rug .
647	One more , we get on the back of his , on his neck , slowly , yeah , wait , slow , slow , slow , good .
648	He 's looking , he 's looking at it . Good boy !
649	Well if you know , yeah comment . This shit is hard to think . Did you rest ? One . Nice . Two .
650	Ridiculous rainbow umbrella to not wet the camera yeah and .
651	Okay we didn 't find a boat to put the weight on , so , but johnson 's creativity has no limits . Hey guys after we made muscle up video .
652	Up and hold ten seconds , and one two three four five six seven eight nine nine and half ten . Nice dude . Okay , anyways work hard .
653	Tell him , be nice to him and tell him it 's bath time . Bath time . Maybe give him a kiss on the ear .
654	Come on . He 's too big . He 's too big ? Go on , pick him up .
655	He 's on your " queen " mat and he 's all dirty , so say , " Phil , get to the bath now ! " ‚Äú Phil , get to the bath now ! ‚Äù Manners .
656	Say good boy , Milo . Good boy , Milo . Now get Phil . Get him .
657	Come on , Phil , this way . No . To bath .
658	For example , in 3D space , to define any point in space , you need an X coordinate , a Y coordinate , and a Z coordinate , and that will give you any point in space .
659	And then we had to include some safety tape , Action Lab branded safety tape so you can set up your experiments properly .
660	You can get a tube like effect , or you can get kind of a tiny planet effect .
661	So this hand pump is pretty cool . You can easily pull around 26 inches mercury here .
662	Tell him , tell him to come outside . Oh , did he get you ?
663	Amelia , look , give paw . Ahh , look ! Wow , Phil .
664	Which one do you want ? Which dog do you want , Phil ? Quick , grab him .
665	Oh , that dobermans got off the park . It 's loose on <unk> <unk> .
666	Oh , take your paw . Paw , Buddy , paw . Get him , right , do the claw .
667	So my idea here is to have all these business people in suits , just being busy walking and generally being absorbed in their phones .
668	He 's basically just thinking , what are we all doing here , standing like this , dressed the same , doing the same thing , and then he 's just gonna fly away .
669	And there 's just something I like about using silhouettes like that . Okay , well , here it is .
670	When you 're going to be holding the same pose for quite a few pages , like eight or ten pages . I find it really helps to make one key drawing first , and use that as your template , and you trace over that same drawing every time .
671	So I 'm just sketching out lots of ideas for a little flying dude , until I find one I like , and then I 'll trace over that one for the animation .
672	These clips will then appear under favourites , which we looked at a minute ago , and you can move down your clips using the slider here to the right of the thumbnails .
673	Now select the deep track icon , and then left click and drag a square over your subject .
674	Here we are going to use deep track , which is the desktop tracking feature . So find your subject in the video .
675	And the keyboard shortcuts i use are spacebar for playing and pausing , and the arrow keys for advancing one frame at a time When i want to make very specific adjustments to my clips .
676	There would be global power outages , and many electronic devices would be damaged and become useless .
677	One by one , each of these satellites , which are protected by the earth 's magnetic field , would be damaged and stopped working .
678	This event will affect all creatures on the planet , as well as the effects on our electromagnetic system , the electric grid , and all things considered part of our modern civilization .
679	Scientists simply do not have enough information to make any conclusion of what is going to happen , but it 's certain that the poles will reverse again at some point .
680	There are several other designs on the probe to keep it sheltered from the heat . Solar panels can open and close depending on how close to the sun the probe is .
681	The probe will also have to withstand , being bombarded by tiny , fast moving particles , some of which will hit the spacecraft . To fix this problem , the parker probe is fitted with kevlar blankets to protect itself from impacts .
682	However , just a few inches past the shield , the spacecraft body will sit at a comfortable 85 degrees fahrenheit .
683	What we do know is that the sun is basically a big hydrogen gas fusion bomb , 93 million miles away from earth , with a surface temperature of 5600 degrees celsius , which is 4000 degrees higher than the melting point of steel .
684	And then there 's an intermediate stage where it 's going to be red . Now the way this is working is when it 's in this yellow state . , that means that the indigo carmine is absorbing all of the blue light .
685	That 's because the molecule is completely reduced , so it can absorb the shorter wavelength light , and then as we give it a little bit more oxygen , now it 's absorbing the green and the blue light , and so it 's producing red light .
686	There we go . That 's awesome ! So right now the reaction is staying yellow because , it 's losing the battle with the oxygen in the air .
687	And now we 're gonna go in . And my arm is so sore because the stabilizer weigh s at least 25 thousand pounds .
688	I 'm like i do . And so she brought me this . I have no idea what it is , but i 'm gonna figure it out now . So because we are exhausted after the snorkeling , Danny and i are actually about to have a lunch date .
689	I could even punch a hole straight through the center . I was kind of worried about hypersonic , molten aluminum particles being flung out by the rocket exhaust , but everything turned out okay .
690	Now the nozzle , pretty important part , it turns the high pressure gas in the combustion chamber into high speed gas as it expands down the exhaust .
691	It is the entire inside of the coconut blasted out just like that . And then we flip the coconut over to drill through the other side .
692	I 've decided not to make a rocket , but what about a rocket engine ? I found this video of some russian guy that made a rocket powered sandblaster , and it 's honestly the best amateur rocket engine i have ever seen on YouTube .
693	You really have to find it . It 's impressive . This rocket engine was so cool . We scavenged for more things to test and you know , we had to try a watermelon .
694	Of course , there are always excuses to be found if we are adamant on skipping a workout .
695	The last key reason is to encourage play . We don 't stop playing because we grow old .
696	So when thinking about how we want to utilize our living room space , we decided to make it a space that 's conducive to keeping our bodies active .
697	So having this private space where we can play and dance like nobody 's watching , has been absolutely amazing and those are the reasons why we ended up with this playground for a living room .
698	Many of us have plans . Plans to keep our bodies healthy , to wake up early , to exercise regularly .
699	Now i got a peek at what the coupon is that banggood is giving us on this one . It 's listing at $ 39 , 99 .
700	We 've got this one here . Ultra lightweight 1 . 57 inch , a full screen , $ 40 again .
701	And then we get into the basic , basic stuff . You 've got your information , push stuff , health things like heart rate , blood pressure and blood oxygen .
702	Yeah , okay . And then it shows you the overall chart as well and explains a bit more about it and how to take the proper measurements so you can get an accurate reading .
703	There 's your qr code in my finger for downloading the tethering app or checking the show notes .
704	If you look closely , you can see a russian naval ship going into the harbor . One of the best ways to discover cuba is of course , in the 50s car .
705	this is why we will also tell you about some of the historic highlights . Beginning with the cars from the 50s you still see everywhere around cuba , and which had become a symbol of the island .
706	Before fidel castro came into power in 1959 , and established a socialist regime in cuba , it was a mecca for tourists from the united states .
707	Oh , my god . Everyone who is super good at skating that 's tried these can 't do it .
708	Things are spazzing out . You can keep I 'm here . Wow , wow , yeah , yeah , Rick . That is terrifying .
709	Oh , oh , yeah .
710	Oh , that was so good . Let 's go , dude .
711	Yep . Oh , oh , my god .
712	Crabs love it , so i might chuck the second one just in here. something should be crawling out of this right here .
713	I came running over just to see if there 's anything that 's been trapped in the water . Sometimes the big tides bring in turtles or stingrays , and they get trapped in here .
714	I 've only got two pots for this bit because i can only carry that much , but it 's just amazing to see how a remote and just fascinate Much fun .
715	Okay , these two are the legal ones I think he 's definitely far out .
716	Wow . I don 't know if i can eat both of these . Actually , i might put that one back . We can just cook up this big fella .
717	Fit , er , orange red kind of looks good already . I like that . -Choose your detail color . -Oh my gosh .
718	Ki-Energy . Uh , how fast your Ki-Energy regenerates , defines amount of moves you can perform while tryna complete puzzles !
719	Oh God ! I have to pick one ? It says details . Okay , defines your amount of health and the energy of cost dodging .
720	Viper Bite . Oh , fuck yeah .
721	Perhaps if you want something that 's a bit sort of lighter and fresher and more easy going , you like raspberry then this is a good one for you .
722	I really like this because i love deep syrupy and fruits of the forest perfumes like this and that tonka bean and vanilla and everything makes this really powerful .
723	Actually , this majors in raspberry , so cherry is gone and this time its raspberry is the star of the show , so it 's a bit lighter and fresher fruity air .
724	Challenge number one , just sheer volume and size and complex to the network .
725	And this is just for one model . Imagine we have many of these models in production so these savings actually get multiplied .
726	No , a thousand doesn 't seem like very much , right ? We just talked about 10 billion packages .
727	We got something that 's like real filipino street . What could that be ? Well , they prepared it special for us and it happens to be fun too .
728	And then colonized by the spaniards for quite a while . So there 's a lot of , like , there 's , like , european influence .
729	Cheers . Wow , that 's really good cornbread . It 's very delicious , you can really . The corn flavor really comes through and the texture is really great .
730	The rice has an egg on it , because if you like it , you should have put egg on it . Wonderful philosophy .
731	Okay , let 's go to the adobo . This one 's a beef with a coconut cream .
732	They have good projection and they have interesting scents that aren 't just the same old , same old as what all other celebrity scents tend to smell like , so i think that 's why they are such good sellers and people keep going back and repurchasing them .
733	Although this one 's a bit harder to pull out blue bottle , but again it 's all about the cradle .
734	So definitely for people that want something comforting and cozy . And if you 're a coconut fan and you haven 't checked out Cloud , you must check it out .
735	It 's all very cool now , of course , the bottle itself and really innovative bottles that she 's done in the past three releases .
736	Glare is mostly notable on high contrasting colors like white on black . For example . However , do consider this , you don 't see as much glare in most games , because colors in game are usually not so contrasting , so you will forget about the glare inside those games .
737	And that concludes my ac5 pro review and i really need some water .
738	I might not have listened to our basic maintenance video . Yeah , do you run a youtube channel or not ? Anyway , this is a really easy way to get started .
739	This is sort of our miscellaneous wall of things that we stick in our pockets when we go on a bike ride . We don 't permanently store food here because the mice will get it , but for short term , it 's okay .
740	Here we have more velo wall posts , which we are using to store wheels . We 've got some victoria airliners , which are kind of a pain to store .
741	And then we 're like , okay , we 'll get a vise , and now that we have it , we use it , we use it all the time . Little charging station over here .
742	As for the microphone , well integrated dual microphones and unfortunately not improved .
743	When compared with the first 5 pro headset , it is a significant upgrade . The display is beautiful , but unfortunately , the new lens design drags that down that pairs with the high price .
744	As you can see , the new lens design does come with a benefit , and that 's a larger horizontal field of view .
745	Unfortunately , the top and bottom are cut off , so the vertical FOV is less than most headsets .
746	You can see here now it 's quite a dark overcast day , so i 'm using a high iso , but this lens has an amazing image stabilization on it , so it 's allowing me to shoot actually a quite low shutter speed , even when i 'm handheld .
747	Now , one thing that you have to be aware , though , when you 're taking photos that close to the subject , is that even at f 5 , 6 , you 're going to have a very narrow depth of field , and it 's very easy to get part of your image out of focus .
748	I 'll be testing this lens out in the field , taking the photos that i like to take , and that 's wildlife and pictures of nature .
